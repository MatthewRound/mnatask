# What next?

* Look at long term storage for the application so that id's can be table ids (if relational).
* The application would require an interface so maybe an api, then a ui of sorts to utilise it.
* I would write some unit tests around the validation (given a criteria to validate against for each attribute in the entity).
* Add some custom validation excpetions around the generic ones that are thrown at the moment.
